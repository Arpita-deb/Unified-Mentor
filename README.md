## Task 1 : Market Capitalization Data Analysis

## Task 2 : Budget Analysis
I analyzed AdventureWorks’ yearly sales data to uncover revenue trends and patterns, product performance, and customer preferences by creating Data Cleaning, Transformation and Analysis Workflows in Alteryx and Data Visualizations in Power BI.
